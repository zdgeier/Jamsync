            <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy policy</h1>
            <p><em>Last updated: April 9, 2023</em></p>
            <p>The privacy of your data -- and it is your data, not ours! -- is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out:
                what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We
                promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.</p>
            <p>This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Zach Geier and JamHub.</p>
            <p>This document has been changed and adapted to JamHub from the open-source Basecamp policy which can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/basecamp/policies">here</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="what-we-collect-and-why">What we collect and why</h2>
            <p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:</p>
            <h3 id="identity-access">Identity & access</h3>
            <p>When you sign up for a JamHub product, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email
                address, and maybe a company name. That's so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you
                product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time
                to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. With your consent, we will send
                you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture
                that displays in our products.</p>
            <p>We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in
                marketing statements without your permission either.</p>
            <h3 id="billing-information">Billing information</h3>
            <p>If you sign up for a paid JamHub product, you will be asked to provide your payment information and
                billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit
                JamHub servers. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.</p>
            <h3 id="product-interactions">Product interactions</h3>
            <p>We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your JamHub product
                accounts. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, to create projects in JamHub.
                We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the 
                content within 60 days.</p>
            <h3 id="geolocation-data">Geolocation data</h3>
            <p>For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that
                for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for
                security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account
                is active.</p>
            <h3 id="website-interactions">Website interactions</h3>
            <p>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as
                conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your
                browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they
                took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web
                analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. The
                web analytics we use are described further in the Advertising and Cookies section.</p>
            <h3 id="advertising-and-cookies">Advertising and Cookies</h3>
            <p>JamHub may run contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn.
                Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to the JamHub marketing site. Where permissible under
                law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends
                information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they
                clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking
                a button or submitting a form.</p>
            <p>We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences,
                make it easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some
                analytics.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site
                preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages
                visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention
                settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won't work
                and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.</p>
            <h3 id="voluntary-correspondence">Voluntary correspondence</h3>
            <p>When you email JamHub with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your
                email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the
                future.</p>
            <p>We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a
                customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or
                use. We will only do so with your express consent.</p>
            <h2 id="when-we-access-or-share-your-information">When we access or share your information</h2>
            <p><strong>To provide products or services you've requested</strong>. We use some third-party subprocessors
                to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. 
            <p>We may share your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of
                our products. </p>
            <p>No JamHub human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for
                example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual
                intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as
                much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to respond
                to legal process (see “When required under applicable law” below).</p>
            <p><strong>To exclude you from seeing our ads.</strong> Where permissible by law and if you have a 
                account, we may share a one-way hash of your email address with ad companies to exclude you from seeing
                our ads.</p>
            <p><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.</strong> If at any point
                we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before
                proceeding.</p>
            <p><strong>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding <a href="/abuse">restricted
                        uses</a>.</strong> Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a
                measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people
                reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If
                we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary,
                including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.</p>
            <p><strong>When required under applicable law.</strong></p>
            <p>JamHub is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we
                    are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request.
                    However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court
                    order requiring us to share data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from
                    government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures
                    outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is JamHubs' policy to notify
                    affected users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in
                    some emergency cases.</li>
                <li>Preservation requests. Similarly, JamHubs' policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only
                    if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a
                    properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless required by
                    law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a
                    proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will
                    destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.</li>
                <li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If
                    that happens, we will share only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption
                    information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, if JamHub is acquired by or merges with another company — we don't plan on that, but if
                it happens — we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes
                subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
            <h2 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information">Your rights with respect to your information</h2>
            <p>At JamHub, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location.
                Some of these rights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected,
                    used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well
                    as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we
                    gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and
                    processing of that information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal
                    information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to
                    certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our
                    possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion
                    requests may prevent you from using JamHub services because our applications may then no longer
                    work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of
                    your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and
                    why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal
                    information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why
                    your personal information is processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we
                    have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object
                    to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from
                    being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary
                    for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on
                    your explicit consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> We do not and will not charge you a different amount
                    to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service
                    because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by
                    virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a
                    href="mailto:zach@jamhub.dev">zach@jamhub.dev</a>. If an authorized agent is corresponding 
                    on your behalf, we will need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.</p>
            <p>If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn
                more about local privacy laws.</p>
            <h2 id="how-we-secure-your-data">How we secure your data</h2>
            <p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a>
                when transmitted from our servers to your browser.</p>
            <h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-content-in-your-product-accounts">What happens when you delete content
                in your product accounts</h2>
            <p>If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be
                purged from our systems in full within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner
                directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts.</p>
            <h2 id="location-of-site-and-data">Location of site and data</h2>
            <p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the
                European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, <strong>please be aware that any
                    information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States</strong>. By
                using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this
                transfer.</p>
            <h2 id="changes-questions">Changes & questions</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.
                Whenever we make a
                significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other
                appropriate steps to notify users.</p>
            <p>Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with
                respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at <a
                    href="mailto:zach@jamhub.dev">zach@jamhub.dev</a> and we'll be happy to try to answer
                them!</p>
